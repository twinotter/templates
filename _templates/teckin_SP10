Some current versions sold [here on Amazon](https://amzn.to/35zd6du) are coming with a non-ESP based chip.

Tuya Convert error: WARNING: it appears this device does not use an ESP82xx and therefore cannot install ESP based firmware

The <b>Teckin model SP10 (N)</b> is based around an RTL8710B which is an unsupported processor.

Some sold are still successfully converted.
